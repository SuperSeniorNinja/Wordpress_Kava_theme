Allows the user to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking. DSGVO / GDPR.

== Description ==

The Basic Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO, EU-DSGVO, GDPR) stipulates that a site visitor must have the option to object to the collection by Google Analytics.

Until now, this was only possible via browser addon, or complicated JavaScript code embedding on the own website. With this plugin, this is child's play and the user also has the option to undo the objection.

**Features**

* **Support for Google Analytics 4 (GA4)**
* Full integration of the new WordPress DSGVO / GDPR features
* Weekly check whether the settings are still data protection compliant!
* Compatible with Google Tag Manager.
* **NO other plugin needed** to use the Google Analytics code on the website. This can be integrated directly by this plugin.
* Site visitors can deactivate the Google Analytics tracking for themselves and also activate it again afterwards.
* Link text for the activation and deactivation link can be changed individually.
* A popup can be set up, which appears after clicking the link.
* The UA-Code can be entered manually or read out automatically by a Google Analytics tracking plugin (see compatible plugins).
* HTML5 Local Storage Fallback: If a user deletes his cookies, the opt-out cookie can be restored if the local storage was not additionally deleted by the browser.
* WordPress Multisite compatible.
* Fully compatible with Gutenberg Editor.
* Compatible with: [Advanced Custom Fields](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/), [WPML](https://wpml.org/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=opt-out-for-google-analytics), [Polylang](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) and [Loco Translate](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/)
* Also works on the smartphone, provided that the browser supports cookies.
* Visual customizations through custom CSS codes that are loaded only together with the shortcode (optimized loading time).
* Translation for DE and EN available.
* Full support for PHP 8

**Regularly check whether the settings are still data protection compliant!**

Ever edited the privacy policy page and accidentally deleted the opt-out shortcode? Recently deleted the plugin for Google Analytics tracking, then reinstalled it and forgot to re-enable IP anonymization?

To ensure the highest security, the plugin regularly checks the settings. Should a setting no longer fit, then an error message appears in the WP Admin (Backend / Dashboad) or you will receive an email.
You can freely choose the frequency of the check. The following intervals are available: daily, weekly or monthly.

The following settings are checked:

* Opt-Out function enabled
* Opt-Out shortcode present on the page
* Page with the shortcode publicly available (published and no password protection)
* Valid UA-Code found (only the formatting is checked)
* IP anonymization enabled (Works only in conjunction with a compatible plugin or the tracking code is stored in the plugin)

**Integrated compatibility with the following plugins**

It is not a requirement to use the listed plugins! The Google Analytics Opt-Out Plugin is also compatible with other plugins and can be used even if the Google Analytics code itself was inserted.
With integrated compatibility, we make work easier because the current UA-Code is automatically read out and kept up to date. This means that it does not have to be corrected manually.

**AUTOMATICALLY current privacy policy**

Keeping track of all the GDPR legislative changes is not easy. Especially not next to the core business. That's why we offer you a data protection generator with our partner [easyRechtssicher](https://schweizer.solutions/datenschutzgenerator).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use this plugin? =

The Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO, EU-DSGVO, GDPR) stipulates that a website visitor must have the option to object to the collection of data by Google Analytics.
Until now, this was only possible via browser addon, or complicated JavaScript code integrations on the own website.
With this plugin, this is very easy and the user also has the option to undo the objection.

= Is it the same opt-out code as from e-recht24.de? =

Yes, because we also comply with Google's specifications. More information about the guidelines:  https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/user-opt-out

= I have manually inserted the Google Analytics tracking code via the theme / a plugin. Can I still use this plugin? =

This plugin can also be used if the tracking code was inserted manually at the theme or with the help of a plugin.

= Does the privacy policy need to be adapted? AUTOMATICALLY update? =

Yes, it is recommended to offer the opt-out for Google Analytics in the privacy policy.

Keeping track of all the GDPR legislative changes is not easy. Especially not next to your core business. That's why we offer you a data protection generator with our partner [easyRechtssicher](https://schweizer.solutions/datenschutzgenerator).
The privacy policy is created ONCE and automatically kept up to date in WordPress itself. No more filling out forms again and copying and pasting privacy statements onto the site, it runs completely automated.
More info here: [https://schweizer.solutions/datenschutzgenerator](https://schweizer.solutions/datenschutzgenerator)

= How long does the unsubscribe remain valid? =

If the site visitor clicks on the opt-out link to disable Google Analytics for him, then a cookie is set. With this cookie, the system knows that this site visitor should not be tracked on the website.

This cookie is only valid in the browser with which the site visitor was on the website and clicked on the opt-out link. If the visitor uses a different browser, he would have to click on the link again.

If the site visitor clears his browser data (cookies, download history, etc.), the cookie is also deleted and the site visitor would have to click on the opt-out link again.

= How do I deactivate the plugin? =

You can deactivate the status of the plugin under "Settings > GA Opt-Out", there you only have to uncheck "Activate opt-out function".

You can deactivate the whole plugin under "Plugins > Installed Plugins" by clicking on "Deactivate" for the "Opt-Out for Google Analytics" Plugin.

After deactivating the plugin, you can remove it completely by clicking on "Delete".

= Where can I use the shortcode? =

You can use the shortcode `[gaoo_optout]` in posts, pages and widgets (text widget).

= Can I as a developer intervene in the plugin? =

Yes, you can. For this purpose we have included appropriate filters and action hooks.

`// Before the shortcode is resolved
add_action( 'gaoo_before_shortcode', 'my_before_shortcode', 10, 2);

function my_before_shortcode( $ua_code, $current_status ) {
	// $ua_code - Der verwendete UA-Code "UA-XXXXX-Y"
	// $current_status - Der aktuelle Status vom Seitenbesucher: activate oder deactivate
}

// After the shortcode is resolved
add_action( 'gaoo_after_shortcode', 'my_after_shortcode', 10, 2);

function my_after_shortcode( $ua_code, $current_status ) {
	// $ua_code - The used UA-Code "UA-XXXXX-Y"
	// $current_status - The current status of the page visitor: activate or deactivate
}

// Before the JS code, to disable GA, is issued
add_action( 'gaoo_before_head_script', 'my_before_script', 10, 1);

function my_before_script( $ua_code ) {
	// $ua_code - The used UA-Code "UA-XXXXX-Y"
}

// After the JS code, to disable GA, is issued
add_action( 'gaoo_after_head_script', 'my_after_script', 10, 1);

function my_after_script( $ua_code ) {
	// $ua_code - The used UA-Code "UA-XXXXX-Y"
}

// The UA-Code used
add_filter( 'gaoo_get_ua_code', 'my_ua_code', 10, 2 );

function my_ua_code( $ua_code, $ga_plugin ) {
	// $ua_code - The used UA-Code "UA-XXXXX-Y"
	// $ga_plugin - Selected source for the UA-Code
}

// Whether the page should be reloaded after the click
add_filter( 'gaoo_force_reload', 'my_force_reload', 10, 1);

function my_force_reload( $force ) {
	// $force - "true" = force reload; "false" = do not reload
}
`

= My theme does not resolve shortcodes. How can I use the function via PHP? =

It happens that some self-developed themes do not resolve shortcodes and the plugin does not work.
To execute the shortcode anyway, you have to use this code in the theme, at the desired position:

`echo do_shortcode('[ga_optout]');`

= It is displayed that the settings are not correct, although I have changed them! =

If the settings have been changed, e.g. in a compatible Google Analytics tracking plugin, then this change will only be noticed during the autom. check (weekly).

It is possible to perform the check beforehand. To do this, the "Save changes" button would have to be clicked under "Settings > GA Opt-Out".

This will read the new settings and save them for a week until the next automatic check.

= How can I react to the clicks, e.g. with another plugin? =

The JavaScript event `gaoptout` is fired on the `window` object, which can be reacted to.

If the page visitor clicks on the link to perform an opt-out, then a `false` is passed as the value. If the visitor performs an opt-in, then a `true` is passed.

Example code:
`jQuery(window).on('gaoptout', function (e) { console.log(e.detail); });`

= How do I change the appearance of the link? =

You have the possibility to change the appearance of the link via CSS in the settings of the plugin. For this purpose, the following CSS classes are available:

**The link itself:**
`#gaoo-link { ... }`

**The link if the page visitor has disagreed with the tracking:**
`.gaoo-link-activate { ... }`

**The link if the page visitor has NOT disagreed with the tracking:**
`.gaoo-link-deactivate { ... }`

= How can I send the status messages to multiple email addresses? =

You can enter several recipient addresses, separated by a comma, into the input field for the e-mail, which should receive the status message.
Example: `webmaster@example.org,admin@example.org,dev@example.org`

= I do not receive emails about the status check? =

The status check runs in the set interval and only sends e-mails if at least one status is set to red.
If you still do not receive any e-mails, it can have the following causes:

- The e-mail has landed in your spam folder. Please check this before and save the sender address in your contact book, this will prevent the emails from ending up in spam.
- You have deactivated the cronjob of WordPress in the wp-config.php. Please make sure that the server-side cronjob works correctly.
- You are using a caching plugin on the installation. If there is no server-side cronjob set up, WordPress will check if there are tasks pending on every page load. If the page is called from the cache, then this is no longer done and no cronjob can be triggered.
- You have too few page visitors who call your website in too large time intervals. Thus the cronjob of WordPress is not triggered.

Our recommendation is therefore:

- Set up a server-side cronjob
- Save the sender address in your contact book

= Use Google Tag Manager =

The opt-out cookie is set according to Google's specifications. Thus, the GTM (Google Tag Manager) should not need to be adjusted.
However, if the Google Analytics code is not loaded at all, the GTM must check whether the cookie is set or whether the value in the "HTML5 Local Storage" is set accordingly.
On this basis, it can be decided in the GTM whether the code should be loaded or not.

If no entry or cookie is present, then no opt-out has taken place. This is also the case if the value "false" is returned.
The opt-out has only taken place if the value "true" is returned.

Specific cookie, with the corresponding UA-Code: ga-disable-UA-XXXXX-YY
Generic Cookie: ga-opt-out

Specific entry in the HTML5 Local Storage:  ga-disable-UA-XXXXX-YY
Generic entry in the HTML5 Local Storage: ga-opt-out

= Liability / Disclaimer =

The use of this plugin is at your own risk. The website operator must be able to ensure the functionality of the plugin itself.
To do this, it must be checked, among other things, whether after clicking on the link, a cookie in this format was set: ga-disable-UA-XXXXXXXX-YY
Supporting, for the Google Tag Manager, another cookie with the name "ga-opt-out" is set.
