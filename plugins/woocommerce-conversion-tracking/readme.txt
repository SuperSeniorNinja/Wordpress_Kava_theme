Adds various conversion tracking codes to cart, checkout, registration success and product page on WooCommerce

== Description ==

When you are integrating any advertising campaigns, they provide various tracking codes (mainly JavaScript) to insert them various pages of your site so that it can track how the conversion is happening.

This plugin inserts those codes on WooCommerce cart page, checkout success page and after user registration. So you can track who are adding your products to cart, who are buying them and who are registering to your site.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

= Minimum Requirements =

* WooCommerce 3.0
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Tracking Conversions =

If you need to track successful purchases, go to the settings and in the **Tags for Successful Order** box, place the JavaScript code you received from the services (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, AdWords) you want to use.

In the JavaScript snippet, there are places where you can use `order_number`, `order_total`, `order_subtotal`, `currency`, etc.

The plugin provides the following codes: <code>{customer_id}</code>, <code>{customer_email}</code>, <code>{customer_first_name}</code>, <code>{customer_last_name}</code>, <code>{order_number}</code>, <code>{order_total}</code>, <code>{order_subtotal}</code>, <code>{currency}</code>, <code>{payment_method}</code>.

Replace the script tag values with the suitable codes the plugin provides and finally insert the snippet in the boxes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with WooCommerce 2.x and 3.x? =

Yes, the plugin works both with the latest v3.x and the older 2.x versions.

= How conversions are tracked? =

We have three different ways of tracking a conversion. The most used one is when a order has been made.

We put the JavaScript scripts provided by you in the page and it fires a conversion event to that scripts site.
